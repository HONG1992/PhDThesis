\lettr{T}he huge number of pathogen species strongly affects human health and ecological systems. 
I examine the role of host population structure and size in maintaining pathogen species richness in an important reservoir host for zoonotic viruses, bats (Order, Chiroptera). 
Firstly I test whether population structure is associated with high viral richness across wild bat species within a comparative phylogenetic analysis. 
I find evidence that bat species with more structured populations have more virus species. 
As this type of study cannot distinguish between specific mechanisms, I then formulate epidemiological models to test whether more structured host populations may allow invading pathogens to avoid competition. 
These models show that population structure does not affect the rate of pathogen invasion by this mechanism. 
Rather, in these models only the disease dynamics within the local group matter. 
As both global host population structure and local group size appear to be important for disease invasion, I use the same modelling framework to compare the importance of host group size and number of groups. 
I find that host group size has a stronger affect than number of groups. 
There are very few population size estimates for bats to directly test the importance of host population size on pathogen richness. 
Therefore I develop a method for estimating bat population sizes from acoustic surveys to assist future research. 
Overall in this thesis, I show that the structure and size of host bat populations can affect their ability to maintain many pathogen species and I provide a method to measure population sizes of bats. These findings increase our understanding of the ecological process of pathogen community construction and can help optimise host surveillance for zoonotic pathogens.

\tmpsection{Kat + dylan, mum and dad}

Firstly and most importantly I would like to thank my wife, Katrina, for helping me beyond measure throughout my PhD.
Although he has contributed very little towards my thesis, I would also like to thank my son, Dylan, for making my life tiring and brilliant for the last two years.
I would also like to thank my parents for the endless support they have given me both during and before my studies.


\tmpsection{supervisors}

I would like to give special thanks to my supervisors, Kate Jones and Hilde Wilkinson-Herbots.
Their guidance has been invaluable.
Their patience, as my drafts progressed from terrible to less-terrible, has been admirable.
Thank you for all your help.
A number of other collaborators and researchers have contributed to, or commented on, various chapters and analyses.
My thanks goes to David Redding, Marcus Rowcliffe, Robin Freeman, Chris Carbone, Andrew Cunningham, James Wood and Francois Balloux.

\tmpsection{Friends and that}

I have been fortunate enough to get to know a large number of fellow students during my time at UCL.
I would like to thank my CoMPLEX cohort for making the masters year hilarious.
In particular thank you Liz for being a great collaborator and for ensuring there was at least one other ecologist in CoMPLEX.
I would also like to thank all those at CBER for making the office such a social place to work: Dave Curnick, for constantly reminding me how poor at squash I am; Henry Ferguson-Gow, for the many music recommendations and discussions; as well as Allie Fairbrass, Ellie Dyer, Laura Nunes, Roee Moar, Prabu Sivasubramaniam, Gee Ferreira, Stuart Nattrass and everyone else.
It would have been very dull without you.
