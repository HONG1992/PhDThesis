\lettr{P}athogens make up a huge proportion of global diversity and their role in disease strongly affects human disease, economics and development as well as having an important ecological role.
However, the factors that control the number of pathogen species are poorly understood.
In this thesis I examine the role population structure and density in maintaining these high levels of diversity in the face of interpathogen competition.
Throughout the thesis I focus on bats as a case study for more general disease processes as they have highly varied social structures and have emerged as important reservoires for zoonotic viruses such as Ebola, SARS, Hendra and Nipah.
