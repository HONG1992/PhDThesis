\lettr{P}athogens make up a huge proportion of global diversity and their role in disease strongly affects human disease, economics and development as well as having an important ecological role.
However, the factors that control the number of pathogen species are poorly understood.
In this thesis I examine the role of population structure and size in maintaining these high levels of diversity.
Throughout the thesis I focus on bats (Order: Chiroptera) as a case study for more general disease processes as they have highly varied social structures and have emerged as important reservoires for zoonotic viruses such as Ebola, SARS, Hendra and Nipah.

In Chapter \ref{ch:empirical} I tested whether population structure is associated with high viral richness in wild bat species.
I find evidence that more structured bat populations --- measured by the number of subspecies and gene flow estimates --- typically have more virus species.
As comparative studies --- as used in Chapter \ref{ch:empirical} --- cannot distinguish between specific mechanisms by which population structure might affect pathogen richness, I simulated epidemiological models to test whether structured populations may allow invading pathogens to avoid competition.
I present the results of these simulations in Chapter \ref{ch:sims1} and find that in populations parameterised to mimic bat populations, population structure neither promotes not hinders invasion and establishment of pathogens.
Instead it is the factors that affect disease spread at the very earliest stages of the epidemic, namely transmission rate, that determine whether or not a new pathogen will invade.
One of the factors that strongly affects disease transmission at the very beginning of an epidemic is the size of the population size which can be decomposed into group size and number of groups in an area.
To clarify the interelations between these measures, and to test which most strongly affects pathogen richness I ran simulations varying group, number of groups, population abundance and population density seperately (Chapter \ref{ch:sims2}) and comparing how they affect the probability of invasion of new pathogens.
I found that population abundance is more important than population density and that the important component of population abundance is group size rather than number of groups.
The importance of population abundance is highlighted in Chapter \ref{ch:sims2} and in the literature but there are very few estimates of abundance for bats.
In Chapter \ref{ch:grem} I present a method for estimating bat abundances from acoustic survays and use individual based simulations to validate its accurancy and precision.


Overall I show that the structure and size of populations can affect their ability to maintain a large number of pathogen species and I provide a new method to measure population sizes of bats.
These findings increases our understanding of the fundemental ecological process of pathogen community construction and can help optimize surveillance for new zoonotic pathogens.
