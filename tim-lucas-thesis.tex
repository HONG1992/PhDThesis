% UCL Thesis LaTeX Template
%  (c) Ian Kirker, 2014
% 
% This is a template/skeleton for PhD/MPhil/MRes theses.
%
% It uses a rather split-up file structure because this tends to
%  work well for large, complex documents.
% We suggest using one file per chapter, but you may wish to use more
%  or fewer separate files than that.
% We've also separated out various bits of configuration into their
%  own files, to keep everything neat.
% Note that the \input command just streams in whatever file you give
%  it, while the \include command adds a page break, and does some
%  extra organisation to make compilation faster. Note that you can't
%  use \include inside an \include-d file.
% We suggest using \input for settings and configuration files that
%  you always want to use, and \include for each section of content.
% If you do that, it also means you can use the \includeonly statement
%  to only compile up the section you're currently interested in.
% You might also want to put figures into their own files to be \input.

% For more information on \input and \include, see:
%  http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/246/when-should-i-use-input-vs-include


% Formatting rules for theses are here:

% This package goes first and foremost, because it checks all 
%  your syntax for mistakes and some old-fashioned LaTeX commands.
% Note that normally you should load your documentclass before 
%  packages, because some packages change behaviour based on
%  your document settings.
% Also, for those confused by the RequirePackage here vs usepackage
%  elsewhere, usepackage cannot be used before the documentclass
%  command, while RequirePackage can. That's the only functional
%  difference.
\RequirePackage[l2tabu, orthodox]{nag}


% ------ Main document class specification ------
% The draft option here prevents images being inserted,
%  and adds chunky black bars to boxes that are exceeding 
%  the page width (to show that they are).
% The oneside option can optionally be replaced by twoside if
%  you intend to print double-sided. Note that this is
%  *specifically permitted* by the UCL thesis formatting
%  guidelines.
%
% Valid options in terms of type are:
%  phd
%  mres
%  mphil
%\documentclass[12pt,phd,draft,a4paper,twoside]{ucl_thesis}
\documentclass[11pt,phd,a4paper,oneside]{stanley}


% Package configuration:
%  LaTeX uses "packages" to add extra commands and features.
%  There are quite a few useful ones, so we've put them in a 
%   separate file.
\input{MainPackages}

% Sets up links within your document, for e.g. contents page entries
%  and references, and also PDF metadata.
% You should edit this!
\input{LinksAndMetadata}

% And then some settings in separate files.
\input{FloatSettings} % For things like figures and tables
\input{BibSettings}   % For bibliographies

% This file has the normal knitr stuff. Should therefore be able to knit content only files and \include{} them.

% At last, content! Remember filenames are case-sensitive and 
%  *must not* include spaces.
\include{Preamble}


\chapter{Introductory Material}
\label{ch:intro}
\include{Introduction}

% Chapter 2
% I switched the order so chapter 2 \includes chapter3
\chapter{The role of population structure in pathogen diversity in wild bat populations}{This work was conducted in collaboration with Kate Jones and Hilde Wilkinson-Herbots}

\label{ch:empirical}
\include{Chapter3}

% Chapter 3
\chapter{Population structure does not increase pathogen diversity in theoretical bat populations}{This work was conducted in collaboration with Kate Jones and Hilde Wilkinson-Herbots}
\label{ch:sims1}
\include{Chapter2}

\chapter{The interactions between population structure and density in pathogen diversity}{This work was conducted in collaboration with Kate Jones and Hilde Wilkinson-Herbots}
\label{ch:sims2}
\include{Chapter4}


\chapter[gREM for estimating animal density]{A generalised random encounter model for estimating animal density with remote sensor data}{
This work was conducted in collaboration with Elizabeth Moorcroft, Robin Freeman, Marcus Rowcliffe and Kate Jones and is now published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution \cite{lucas2015generalised}.
The text here is almost completely reproduced from \textcite{lucas2015generalised}.
I formulated and analysed the analytical model.
Elizabeth Moorcroft wrote the simulations.
I led the writing of the manuscript, but much of it was written by Elizabeth Moorcroft and other coauthors.

\include{Discussion}



\include{Appendices} 
% You could separate these out into different files if you have
%  particularly large appendices.

% This line manually adds the Bibliography to the table of contents.
% The fact that \include is the last thing before this ensures that it
% is on a clear page, and adding it like this means that it doesn't
% get a chapter or appendix number.
%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}

% Actually generates your bibliography.
\printbibliography 

% All done. \o/
