\tmpsection{What I did}

\begin{itemize}
\item In this thesis I aimed to test the importance of population structure and density on pathogen diversity
\item With a particular focus on bats
\item Combining simulations and empirical studies.
\item Identify that population structure does affect pathogen richness in wild bats.
\item But found that invasision of new pathogens is probably not the mechanism.  
\item Clarified the relationships between population size and density, range size, colony size and population structure.
\item And found that colony size is more important than density per se. 
\item Finally, created a method to more easily estimate bat population densities.
\end{itemize}



\tmpsection{How I did it (Chapters overview)}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item I tested the hypothesis that population structure predicts viral richness in wild bats.
\item I used two measurements of population structure.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A novel measure, number of subspecies. Largest dataset to date.
  \item Gene flow, dealing with issues of marker type and spatial scale
\end{enumerate}
\item I used multivariate regression, appraised with information theory techniques.
\item I controlled for phylogeny.
\item I found that in both analyses, increased population structure predicts increased pathogen richness and is in best model.
\end{itemize}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item I modelled a multi-pathogen, metapopulation based on bat populations.
\item Testing the specific mechanism that population structure increases richness by enabling invasion of newly evolved pathogens.
\item I found that spatial structure, either by dispersal rate or topology, did not allow invasion.
\end{itemize}

\item
\begin{itemize}
\item I clarified confusion on the relationships between group size, group number, density, population size and range size.
\item Using same model as Chapter 3 I tested whether it is in fact density or population size that matters.
\item I tested whether the importact factor in increased density is group size or group number.
\item I found that it is in fact abundance and group size that matter much more than other factors.
\end{itemize}


\item
\begin{itemize}
\item I aimed to collect data on bat density as lit. says this is important.
\item Discovered I needed a model.
\item Started with specific model for iBats, ended up writing general model.
\item I formulated a model that estimates density from acoustic sensors or camera traps.
\item I tested it using simulations.
\item I found it to be precise and unbiased.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}






\tmpsection{What agreed/disagreed with the literature.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Don't find high $R_0$ leads to high richness in contrast to eco assumption.
\item Don't find structure makes any difference in contrast to poletto and \cite{nunes2006localized} and ackleh.
\item Find that colony size is more important which implies density is just proxy for group size. Group size \emph{is} density at small scale.
\item Importance of colony size agrees with nunn primate papers.
\end{itemize}



\tmpsection{What are the implications for research?}


\begin{itemize}
\item Global change and pop structure.
\item Structure is not a strong enough predictor to use for zoonotic surveillance. Perhaps colony size is.
\item Studies should more carefully consider density vs structure vs group size.
\item Population structure should be studied in other groups other than bats.
\item Can more easily estimate bat density.
\end{itemize}






\tmpsection{Furtherwork and limitations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Collect data for colony size and test importance against structure.
\item Limitations of poor data, escpecially for gene flow.
\item Examine other mechanisms for richness
\item Examine multi host species more carefully
\item Field test gREM
\item Use gREM to collect density estimates 
\end{itemize}


\tmpsection{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Population structure does influence pathogen richness but the mechanisms are still unclear.
\item Local dynamics (local density) are most important for pathogen invasions not broad scale structure.
\item Data on density should be collected using the gREM.
\end{itemize}
