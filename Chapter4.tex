\lettr{A}n increasingly large fraction of emerging diseases come from wild animals and these diseases have a huge impact on human health.
The chance that a new disease will come from any particularly host species increases with the number of pathogen species in that host species.
However, the factors that control pathogen richness in wild populations are still poorly understood.
%\tmpsection{Two to three sentences of more detailed background}
Population density is thought to increase pathogen richness while theory suggests that population structure and population size may also play a role.
However, these factors are intrinsically linked --- reducing density reduces contacts between individuals and directly reduces population size.
In group living species group size and the total number of groups both contribute to total population size. 
As these factors are all completely interdependent, it is very difficult to study them empirically e.g., in a comparative frame work.

I found that increased group size increases the chance that a new pathogen will invade into a population to the largest extent.
Both group size and the number of groups (i.e.\ the components of population size) promote pathogen richness more than population density.
This implies that, in comparative studies, population density is merely a correlate of group size or population size.
As these factors are not equally important it is expected that the pathogen communities of different host species will respond to climate change in different ways.
Species which experience changes in group size are expected to have larger changes in pathogen richness than other species.

\tmpsection{General Intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% A basic introduction to the field,

%1. Zoonotics important - determinants of pathogen richness important

Zoonotic diseases are an increasingly important source of human infectious diseases \cite{jones2008global, woolhouse2006host, taylor2001risk}.
The chance that a new zoonotic disease will come from a particular host reservoir depends on a number of factors including the number of pathogen species it carries \cite{wolfe2000deforestation}.
It is well known that population level factors such as population density, range size and population structure have an important role in controlling pathogen dynamics \cite{anderson1979population, may1979population, colizza2007invasion, may2001infection}.
However, the relative importance of these factors, in controlling pathogen richness, is largely unknown.


%Global change is strongly perturbing wild animal populations \cite{thomas2004extinction, craigie2010large}, but without good mechanistic models of how these populations maintain pathogen species richness, we can not predict how pathogen communities, and the risks of zoonotic outbreaks, will change in the coming decades.

%2. review the evidence for comparative studies for size and other interrelated variables first as that is the order you do it in other chapters

\tmpsection{Density/size/structure in comparative research}
With the increase of novel zoonotic pathogens \cite{jones2008global} much attention has been devoted to comparatively assessing the factors that are associated with high or low pathogen richness in wild animal species (Chapter~\ref{ch:empirical}, \cites{poulin2000diversity, kamiya2014determines, luis2013comparison}).
Many comparative studies have examined morphological or life history traits \cite{kamiya2014determines, luis2013comparison}.
However, factors related to population biology are also expected to affect disease dynamics and therefore affect pathogen richness.

Population density is commonly included in comparative studies and seems to promote high pathogen richness \cite{morand1998density, kamiya2014determines, lindenfors2007parasite, nunn2003comparative, arneberg2002host}.
In contrast, population size has rarely been directly studied as a predictor of pathogen richness.
Studies also often test for correlations between pathogen richness and range size \cite{lindenfors2007parasite, nunn2003comparative, turmelle2009correlates, huang2015parasite, kamiya2014determines}.
Overall it seems that species with larger geographic range sizes have higher pathogen richness \cite{kamiya2014determines}.
While population structure can be difficult to define and measure, a number of studies have found that increased population structure is associated with increased pathogen richness (Chapter \ref{ch:empirical}, \cites{maganga2014bat, turmelle2009correlates}).
Finally, many studies have tested for correlations between pathogen richness and group size, though results are equivical \cite{vitone2004body, gay2014parasite, ezenwa2006host, rifkin2012animals, nunn2003comparative}.


%2 But problems with interrelated variables

However, the intrinsic relationships between these variables are rarely discussed or accounted for in comparative studies.
There are two particularly clear relationships between these variables.
Firstly, population size, $N$, density, $d$, and area, $a$, are linked by $N = da$ (See Table~\ref{t:params} for all parameters used).
The relationship, $N \propto a$, has broad empirical support \cite{blackburn2006variations, borregaard2010causality}.
Secondly, population size can be decomposed into two components, the number of groups, $m$, and the average size of a group, $n$, with $N = nm$.
While less clear, range size and population structure are also related.
The amount of movement between groups is at least partially dependent on the distance between them \cite{jenkins2010meta, le2012patterns, schooley2009enhancing} and the distance between neighbouring groups decreases with the number of groups per area, $m/a$.




%4. then talk about the limitations of taking a comparative approach and how mechanistic models can help


As these population factors --- population size, population density, range size and group size --- are likely to be colinear due to the above relationships, correlative comparative studies will struggle to distinguish between them.
It as well acknowledged that correlative studies cannot prove causality.
This issue is exacerbated when there are clear, causal relationships between explanatory variables (e.g.\ an increase in density will directly cause an increase in population size).
However, if the aim of correlative studies is to create predictive models for estimating pathogen richness of wild animal species, these interelationships are not an issue.
As long as two of three variables in each of the above relationships ($d = N/a$ and $N = nm$) are included in a statistical model, all the variance in the data will be captured.

However, if the aim is to know which factors are causally affecting pathogen richness, and the mechanisms by which they control pathogen richness, correlative approaches are less useful.
Correlative models will be unable to select the causal factor out of correlated factors.
Furthermore, understanding the mechanisms by which population factors can affect pathogen richness has a number of important benefits.
Mechanistic models are expected to be more predictive into the future and into hitherto unseen population regimes.
These popalation-level factors, although interrelated, will respond differently to global change and the response will be species dependent.
Some species may suffer large range contractions, and therefore large falls in population size, while their density remains fairly constant \cite{thomas2004extinction}.
Other species might retain their distribution but have a depressed population density \cite{craigie2010large}.
Furthermore, different mechanisms of maintenance and creation of pathogen richness will respond to changes in these factors differently as well.
If pathogen richness ultimately depends on the size of the host population, as predicted by island biogeography, then falls in population size will reduce pathogen richness the most.
If local group size affects the ability of new pathogens to invade (\textcite{nunn2003comparative}, Chapter \ref{ch:sims1}) then changes in group size are likely to be more important \cite{lehmann2010apes, zunino2007habitat, manor2003impact, atwood2006influence}.





%5. review the evidence for mechanistic studies
%6. limitations of the mechanistic approach so far

Theoretical studies have established that a number of population factors are important for population dynamics generally and for the maintenance of pathogen richness specifically.
Population density and structure are well established as having a central role in pathogen dynamics \cite{colizza2007invasion, barthelemy2010fluctuation, wu2013threshold, may1979population, anderson1979population}.
Group size is also known to strongly affect disease dynamics with disease spreading more quickly through populations made up of larger groups \cite{colizza2007invasion}.
Fewer studies specifically study how these factors affect pathogen coexistence.
A number of studies find that increased population structure can promote pathogen coexistence \cite{qiu2013vector, allen2004sis, nunes2006localized}.


While many theoretical studies have examined whether these population level factors can promote pathogen richness, none have attempted to distinguish which might be the most important in the wild.
Most studies have examined how pathogen coexistence depends on pathogen traits such as the transmission rate and virulence \cite{allen2004sis, may1994superinfection}.
This focus is more relavent to studies of pathogens in humans and how different human pathogens may coexist.
The context of comparing wild host species has been largely ignored.



%7. what you are going to do that is new (ie tease apart these interdependencies) - using case study on bats (and why this is a good group to ask this particular question on)


Therefore there is great need for mechanistic models that try to disentangle the interplay between these many factors: density, population size, range size, population structure, group size and the number of groups.
Here, I have used multipathogen, metapopulation models to individually vary these population parameters.
The metapopulations were parameterised to broadly mimic wild bat populations.
The size of bat groups (colonies) is very variable and they are often very stable \cite{kerth2011bats, mccracken1981social}.
Furthermore, bats are particularly relavent in the context of zoonotic disease as they are thought to be reservoirs for a number of important, recent outbreaks \cite{calisher2006bats, li2005bats}.
I examined how these population factors affect the ability of a newly evolved pathogen to invade and persist in a population in the presence of strong competition from an endemic pathogen strain.
I used these simulations to test two specific hypotheses.
First, I tested whether population size or population density more strongly promotes the invasion of a new pathogen.
Secondly, I tested whether the invasion of a new pathogen is more strongly promoted by colony size or the number of colonies.
I found that population size has a much stronger affect on the invasion of a new pathogen than population density and that increasing population size by increasing group size promotes pathogen invasion much more than increasing population size by increasing the number of groups.

\subsection{Metapopulation model}

\tmpsection{Overview}


I used a two-pathogen, metapopulation SIR model to compare the roles of demographic parameters on pathogen species richness.
Specifically I let two identical pathogens --- an endemic pathogen and an invading pathogen --- compete and used persistence or not of the second pathogen as my response variable.
I tested whether population size is more important than population density.
I then tested whether colony size or the number of colonies is the more important component of population size.
The multipathogen SIR model is identical to that in Chapter \ref{ch:sims1} and is implemented in \emph{R} \cite{R}.
The code used for running all simulations is available at \url{https://github.com/timcdlucas/PhDThesis/blob/master/Chapter4.Rtex}.


In each simulation the population is seeded with 20 individuals infected with pathogen 1 in each colony. 
Pathogen 1 is then allowed to spread and reach equilibrium. 
After \ensuremath{7\times 10^{5}} events, 5 individuals infected with pathogen 2 are added to one randomly selected colony. 
After another \ensuremath{3\times 10^{5}} events the invasion of pathogen 2 is considered successful if any individuals with pathogen 2 still remain.

\subsection{Independent variables}

Three independent variables were varied: colony size, number of colonies and area.
From these parameters, population size and population density can be calculated.
The default values of these parameters was a population size of \SI{8000} individuals split into 20 colonies of 400 individuals.
The default area of the simulations was \SI{10000}{\square\kilo\metre} (space is given in square kilometres for simplicity even though they are in fact arbitrary units).

Three sets of simulations were run.
First, colony size was varied using values 100, 200, 400, 800 and \SI{1600}.
The number of colonies was kept constant and so population size varied directly proportionally with colony size.
Area was scaled to keep population density constant. 
Secondly, number of colonies (and therefore population size) was varied and again area was varied to keep density constant.
5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 colonies were used.
Finally, colony size and number of colonies were kept constant (therefore keeping population size constant) and area was varied alone to alter population density. 
The values of area used were \SI{40000}, \SI{20000}, \SI{10000}, \SI{5000} and \SI{2500}{\square\kilo\metre} which gave density values of 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 animals.\si{\per\square\kilo\metre}.

The effects of area occur through changing the metapopulation network.
The metapopulation structure was created for each simulation by randomly placing colonies in space (Figure~\ref{fig:colonyNetworkPlots}).
The spatial scale of the simulations vary between \SI{2500} and \SI{40000}{\square\kilo\metre}.
This corresponds to square areas with sides of 50 to \SI{200}{\kilo\metre}.
Dispersal can only occur between two colonies if they are within \SI{100}{\kilo\metre} of each other i.e.\ they are then counted as connected nodes in the metapopulation network.
The number of connections each colony has is called its degree, $k$.
How well connected the metapopulation network is overall is measured by the mean degree, $\bar{k}$.
This random placement does not guarantee that the population is connected (i.e.\ made up of a single connected component) but as the endemic pathogen is seeded in all colonies, the invading pathogen cannot be seeded into a fully susceptible colony.
This was considered more realistic than repeatedly resampling the population until a fully connected population occurred.
The threshold of \SI{100}{\kilo\metre} was arbitrary but I aimed to maximise the range  of $\bar{k}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:plotK}) while not having many simulations with networks that were not fully connected.
Given this setup, simulations with low densities had relatively unconnected metapopulation networks while high density populations had fully connected networks.



\subsection{Other Parameters}


The fixed parameters used are chosen to roughly reflect realistic wild bat populations. 
The death rate $\Lambda$ is set as 0.05 per year giving a generation time of 20 years.
The birth rate is set to be equal to $\mu$ so that the population size is stable.
The recovery rate $\gamma$ is set to 1 giving a average infection duration of 1 years. 
This is therefore a long lasting infection but not a chronic infection. 
It is difficult to estimate the duration of infections in wild bats but it seems that these infections may often be long lasting \cite{peel2012henipavirus, plowright2015ecological}.
However, much shorter infectious periods have also been identified \cite{amengual2007temporal}.
These shorter lived infections are not studied further here.

Cross-immunity is set to 0.1 so that coinfection is 90\% less likely than an initial infection.
This is an arbitrary value that is based on the fact that the rationale of the model is that the invading species is a newly speciated strain of the endemic species.
Furthermore, the model assumes complete cross-immunity after recovery from infection.
Therefore cross-immunity to coinfection is also likely to be strong.
Three values, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3, of the transmission rate $\beta$ are used.
All simulations are run under all three transmission rates.


\subsection{Statistical comparisons}

I tested two hypotheses.
Firstly I tested the hypothesis that an increase in population size creates a stronger increase in invasion probability (of the second pathogen) than an equal increase in population density.
Secondly, I tested the hypothesis that an increase in colony size creates a stronger increase in invasion probability than a proportionally equal increase in number of colonies.
To statistically test these hypotheses I combined the results from different simulations and fitted multiple logistic regressions, centering and scaling the independent variables.
Specifically, I fitted the model 
\begin{align}
  \text{Invasion} = b_1 d + b_2 n + b_3 m + c + \epsilon
\end{align}
where $d, n$ and $m$ are density, colony size and number of colonies respectively and $b_i$ are the regression coefficients. 
$c$ is a fitted intercept and $\epsilon$ is a binomially distributed error term.
To test the first hypothesis I compared the size (and 95\% confidence intervals) of $b_1$ to $b_2$ and $b_3$.
To test the second hypothesis I compared $b_2$ to $b_3$.






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{Results}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%     Results text    %%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

At the default parameter settings, the probability of invasion and establishment of the second pathogen, $P(I)$,  was rare ($\beta = 0.1,\: P(I) = 0.02;\: \beta = 0.2,\: P(I) = 0;\: \beta = 0.3,\: P(I) = 0.06$).
Although there is no clear, directional relationship, these proportions are significantly different ($\chi^2$ test: $\chi^2 = 17.21,\: \text{df} = 2,\: p = 0$).

In 37 simulations, both of the pathogens went extinct.
This did not depend on transmission rate ($\chi^2$ test: $\chi^2 = 1.51,\: \text{df} = 2,\: p = 0.47$).
However they were all either in simulations with the smallest colony size (colony size = 100, 29 simulations) or with the fewest colonies (5 colonies, 8 simulations).
Results from these simulations were removed before further analyses.



\subsection{Population density or size}

To test whether population density or size has a stronger affect on invasion probability I compared the regression coefficients of the multiple regressions fitted to simulation results (Figure~\ref{fig:plotValueChangeMeans}).
Increasing population size, either by increasing colony size or number of colonies, increased the probability of invasion (Table~\ref{t:regrCoefs}).
The relationship between colony size and invasion is strong and significant at all transmission rates, while the relationship between colony number and invasion is weaker and more marginally significant.
In contrast, varying population density does not alter invasion probability.
Therefore the simulations support the hypothesis that population size affects invasion more strongly than population density.


\subsection{Colony size or number of groups}

To test whether colony size or the number of colonies is the more important component of population size, I compared the regression coefficients, $b_2$ and $b_3$, of the multiple regressions fitted to simulation results (Figure~\ref{fig:plotTransMeans}).
Increasing colony size or the number of colonies increases the probability of invasion but this affect is much stronger and more statistically significant, for colony size (Table~\ref{t:regrCoefs}).
Therefore the simulations support the hypothesis that colony size is the more important component of population size.

\section{Discussion}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\tmpsection{Restate results}

Overall, my results suggest that population size promotes pathogen richness significantly more than population density in the context of metapopulations or group living.
Furthermore, the component of population size that is important is colony size.

These results lead to a number of other conclusions.
All else being equal, increasing range size (with density remaining constant) will not increase pathogen richness significantly unless the increased range size promotes larger groups.
Furthermore, social species that live in large groups are likely to harbour more pathogen species, even if sociality promotes reduced interactions between groups due to territory defence or simply because of larger distances between groups due to groups needing larger home ranges than solitary individuals.


\tmpsection{Why are these results like that? What do they mean?}

For related, strongly competing strains, the factor that most strongly allows new pathogens to invade is the number of susceptible individuals in the local group.
As long as there are enough susceptible individuals that the new pathogen species persists through the stochastic, early stages of the epidemic, the new pathogen will persist.
As dispersal is a very slow process compared to infection, the global pool of susceptibles is not important. 
This is why increasing the number of colonies does not increase pathogen invasion as quickly as the size of a colony does.
Similarly, the density --- at the global scale --- of the species has little affect.
In these simulations, increasing density without increasing population size implies a reduction in range size, which simply increases the number of colonies which are connected to the colony experiencing the invading pathogen.
This increases the pool of susceptibles that are within one dispersal of the invading pathogen.
However, again, this affect is very weak compared to the strong changes in local disease dynamics caused by increasing colony size.



\subsection{Global change}

It is clear that many species are suffering strong population changes due to climate change \cite{thomas2004extinction}.
However these changes might affect range size \cite{thomas2004extinction}, population size \cite{craigie2010large}, population connectivity \cite{wasserman2013population, rivera2015habitat, fonturbel2014forest} or group size \cite{lehmann2010apes, zunino2007habitat, manor2003impact, atwood2006influence} to different extents.
My results suggest that pathogen communities will respond differently depending on which factors are affected, although it should be noted that the mechanism here --- invasion of a new pathogen --- is possibly more relevant over longer, multi-generation time scales than decade-long time scales.
In short, species suffering reductions in groups size \cite{lehmann2010apes, zunino2007habitat, manor2003impact, atwood2006influence} are predicted to experience decreases in pathogen richness in the long term and there is some evidence that this process is occurring \cite{altizer2007threatened, turmelle2009correlates}.
Species that are experiencing increases in group size \cite{lehmann2010apes} would be expected to gain new pathogen species.
In contrast, species suffering range contractions \cite{thomas2004extinction} and decreases in population size \cite{craigie2010large} are expected to experience smaller changes in pathogen richness.


\subsection{Comparative studies}

Many comparative studies measure some aspect of a species population size or structure, yet it is rarely discussed how these relate.
Instead most studies use the data that are available, without considering \emph{a priori} how it may depend on other factors (though statistical correlations between independent variables is usually considered and dealt with using PCA or by removing colinear variables).
Population density is often measured \cite{morand1998density, lindenfors2007parasite, nunn2003comparative, arneberg2002host} yet density is directly associated with population size.
This study suggests that it is in fact population size that is important (in the context of social species as studied here).
Therefore, the density measures in these comparative studies are more likely to be proxies for population size than the true causal factor.
Similarly, this study suggests that host range size does not promote pathogen richness by the mechanism studied here, yet a number of studies have found evidence of this relationship \cite{kamiya2014determines, nunn2003comparative}.
This suggests that either the relationship found in comparative studies is in fact due to a correlation with another factor, or that mechanisms other than probability of invasion of new pathogens are important.
Range size has been suggested to affect pathogen richness by a number of mechanisms such as increasing the number of sympatric species and these other mechanisms should be specifically tested \cite{luis2013comparison}.

The studies that have tested specifically the affect of group size have in fact found both positive \cite{vitone2004body} and negative associations \cite{gay2014parasite} or no relationship \cite{ezenwa2006host}.
Meta-analyses suggest that the relationship between social group size and pathogen richness is weak \cite{rifkin2012animals}.
This suggests that the mechanism studied here --- invasion of recently evolved pathogens --- is not the major cause of pathogen richness in wild populations.



\subsection{Assumptions and limitation}

Being based on the same model as used earlier, the work presented here relies on many of the same assumptions (see Section~\ref{s:sims1Disc}).
Furthermore, as a comparison is being made between the effects of area and population size, the exact specifications of how the metapopulation is affected by area is important.
I have conducted this study at one rate of dispersal, 0.01 dispersals per individual per year.
In practice this relates to only 17\% of individuals dispersing in their lifetime.
This low rate of dispersal is expected to exaggerate the effect of area; at high rates of dispersal the population is essentially well-mixed, despite the metapopulation.
Furthermore, there is evidence that as groups get bigger, the within-group structure increases \cite{nunn2015infectious}.
This has not been modelled here; instead the subpopulations are assumed to be fully mixed regardless of size.

Also, I have assumed that dispersal only occurs between colonies a certain distance apart.
Based on \emph{a priori} considerations such as the time and energy required to disperse long distances this is a reasonable assumption.
The exact threshold was chosen to attempt to maximise the range of $\bar{k}$ studied (Figure~\ref{fig:plotK}).
However, a similar assumption could be made in other ways.
Instead of a threshold distance, individuals could be expected to disperse in a random direction and stop at the first colony they encounter; this could create some long distance links in the network and increase network connectivity, potentially reducing the effects of area.
Alternatively, the metapopulation could have been modelled as a weighted network with dispersal occurring at a higher rate to nearby colonies.
Depending on the parameterisation of this distance-dispersal relationship this could serve to increase the affect of area --- by exaggerating dispersal to very nearby colonies --- or decrease the affect of area by allowing rare, but significant, global dispersal creating a small-world network structure.
Ultimately, the modelling choices could increase or decrease the affects of area relative to colony size and the number of colonies but I have aimed to make the effect of area as strong as possible.




\tmpsection{Further correlations between factors}

I have used the simple relationships between demographic factors --- density = population size / area for example --- to illustrate that these are tightly linked.
In order to isolate the effects of these factors I have assumed these simple relationships hold; to examine density without altering population size I have fixed population size and manipulated area.
However, in reality, these are likely to covary both within species across time and also between species.
Therefore, while these quantities are certainly linked, they cannot be assumed to have simple linear relationships and should not be used as proxies of each other without further examination.
For example, rates and distances of dispersal --- which affect the influence of space --- may be related to local density \cite{marjamaki2013local}.
Similarly it is unlikely that a species whose range size decreases will not experience a decrease in total population size as well; the range contraction is likely to occur over generations rather than a simple squeezing of the existing individuals into a smaller area.




\subsection{Conclusions}

Overall I have shown that while a number of demographic factors are intrinsically linked, they have different effects on the rate at which new pathogens will invade.
I found that population size, not density, has the stronger impact on the ability of a pathogen to invade.
Furthermore, species with large groups are likely to harbour more pathogens than species with many, smaller groups.
Due to the correlations between these factors, they are particularly hard to study within a comparative framework; this highlights the utility of mechanistic models.
