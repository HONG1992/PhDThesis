\lettr{S}ome stuff about things. Some more things.  \blindtext

\section{General intro}

\tmpsection{There is great diversity, much of it unknown and mechanisms still not understood}
Total mammalian viral diversity.
Known mammal viruses?

Bit about how to search for viruses? Deep pcr etc.


\tmpsection{This diversity poses a zoonotic risk}

Number of known zoonotic viruses/pathogens.
Number of known from mammals.
Examples of mortality rates and examples of scale of outbreaks.

\tmpsection{Bats are a particular culprit of this risk}

Some outbreaks caused by bats.
Number of known bat viruses, known bat zoonoses.

Bats are second largest order of mammals.
Long lived, social and fly.


\section{Specific  intro}
\subsection{Pathogen richness}

Define.
Simple count of pathogens across whole species.
Ignores heterogeneit in prevalence, across space and time.

\tmpsection{Pathogen diversity is poorly understood}


\tmpsection{Known factors that affect richness}


\tmpsection{Describe structure and density}

\tmpsection{Theoretical evidence that structure and density increase richness}


\tmpsection{Empirical evidence from mammals}


\tmpsection{Pathogen diversity has an important role in zoonotic diseases and we can optimise surveillance if we understand it}
