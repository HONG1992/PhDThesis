\tmpsection{General intro}

\tmpsection{There is great diversity, much of it unknown and mechanisms still not understood} % context

\lettr{T}he diversity of pathogens is huge and largely unknown \cite{poulin2014parasite}.
Recent large studies have found tens \cite{anthony2013strategy} or even hundreds of virus species in a single host species \cite{anthony2015non}.
This suggests the number of mammalian viruses globally is of the order of hundreds of thousands of virus species \cite{anthony2013strategy} while only 3,000 species of virus, across all host groups, are currently described \cite{ICTV}.
Recent large databases include nearly 2,000 pathogens from approximately 400 wild animal hosts \cite{wardeh2015database}.
Given that there are nearly 4,000 named mammal species \cite{wilson2005mammal}, the undiscovered diversity of pathogens is likely huge.

In general we can expect competition between pathogens.
Competition between pathogens can occur by different me	chanisms: immunological mechanisms such as cross-immunity or shared immune response \cite{fenton2010applying} and ecological mechanisms such as removal of susceptible hosts by death \cite{rohani2003ecological} or competition for internal host resources \cite{griffiths2014analysis}.
Like ecological systems this competition leads us to expect competitive exclusions \cite{bremermann1989competitive, martcheva2013competitive, ackleh2003competitive, ackleh2014robust, turner2002impact} so the diversity of parasites needs an explanation.

\tmpsection{This diversity poses a zoonotic risk} %significance

This diversity of pathogens presents a risk to human health.
60\% of newly emerged disease are zoonotic (acquired from animals) with wild animals being the predominant source \cite{jones2008global, woolhouse2006host, taylor2001risk}.
Zoonotic diseases can be extremely virulent with viruses such as Nipah \cite{luby2009recurrent} and Ebola \cite{lefebvre2014case} having case fatality rates over 50\%.
Furthermore these pathogens can have large economic costs (\emph{e.g.}, SARS is estimated to have cost \$40 billion \cite{knobler2004learning}).
In particular these impacts can have huge effects on developing economies.
For example the 2014 Ebola epidemic caused both Liberia and Guinea to fall from positive to negative per capita growth rates \cite{ebolaWorldbank, ebola2015worldbank} while death rates per 1,000 people living with AIDS are up to ten times higher in developing countries than in Europe and North America \cite{granich2015trends}.


\tmpsection{Pathogen diversity has an important role in zoonotic diseases and we can optimise surveillance if we understand it}

Surveillance of zoonotic diseases is crucial to mitigate these health impacts.
In particular we want to categorise diseases before they spillover into humans (SARS was not identified until months into the pandemic for example \cite{drosten2003identification}) and we want to anticipate outbreaks. 
If we know there is an increased number of infections in host species, increased numbers of a species that is a known reservoir of a high risk zoonotic disease, or increased contacts between humans and a pathogen reservoir, we can prepare for a potential outbreak in that area.

However, funds for zoonotic surveillance are limited and so efforts must be optimised.
Knowing which species are likely to have many pathogens allows us to sample and identify potentially zoonotic viruses efficiently.
Suggested factors that might control pathogen richness include individual traits (body mass \cite{kamiya2014determines, arneberg2002host, poulin1995phylogeny} and longevity \cite{nunn2003comparative, ezenwa2006host}) as well as environmental factors such as latitude \cite{poulin2010latitudinal, kamiya2014determines}.
Furthermore, population level traits that affect the dynamics of disease spread have also been studied (animal density \cite{kamiya2014determines, nunn2003comparative, arneberg2002host}, sociality \cite{bordes2007rodent, vitone2004body, altizer2003social, ezenwa2006host}, population structure \cite{nunes2006localized, maganga2014bat, gay2014parasite, turmelle2009correlates} and  species range size \cite{kamiya2014determines, nunn2003comparative}).
This understanding provides a basis for predicting which species will have high pathogen richness and should be prioritised for sampling and surveillance.
Furthermore, given a good mechanistic understanding of how pathogen richness is created and maintained we can start to predict how pathogen richness, and therefore zoonotic disease risk, will respond to global change.



\tmpsection{Specific intro}

\section{Bats as reservoirs of zoonotic diseases}

\tmpsection{Bats are a particular culprit of this risk, and have unknown diversity and interesting population structure.} %context

In recent decades bats have been implicated in a number of high profile zoonotic outbreaks including Nipah \cite{field2001natural, halpin2011pteropid}, Ebola \cite{leroy2005fruit}, SARS \cite{li2005bats} and Hendra \cite{field2001natural}.
This has lead to much research on whether bats are a particular source of zoonotic disease \cite{luis2013comparison, olival2015bats, wang2011mass} and examinations of factors, such as flight, social living and longevity, that might predispose them to being reservoires of zoonotic viruses \cite{calisher2006bats, o2014bat, dobson2005links, racey2015uniqueness, kuzmin2011bats}.
Given that bats are the second largest order of mammals \cite{wilson2005mammal}, we may expect them to be the source of many viruses simply through weight of numbers \cite{luis2013comparison}.
The broad conclusions are that while bat do host more zoonotic viruses than other groups \cite{luis2013comparison} they do not host more virus species in general \cite{olival2015bats}.
Questions remain as to why bat viruses have a tendency to have such high zoonotic potential.

Many factors of bat populations make them epidemiologically interesting.
Firstly, the population density of most bat species is largely unknown.
As they are small, nocturnal and difficult to identify in flight, estimating there density is incredibly difficult without disruptive and time consuming roost surveys.
As this parameter is tightly linked to pathogen richness \cite{kamiya2014determines} and central to epidemiological models \cite{may1979population, anderson1979population} these leaves large gaps in our understanding of disease processes in this group.
Secondly they have highly varied and sometimes complex social structures \cite{kerth2008causes}.
While some species are largely solitary or live in very small groups (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Lasiurus borealis} \cite{shump1982lasiurus}) some species live in colonies of millions of individuals (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Pteropus scapulatus} \cite{birt2008little}).
These groups can be very stable \cite{kerth2011bats, mccracken1981social}.
Further complexity arises due to their propensity for seasonal migration \cite{fleming2003ecology, richter2008first, cryan2014continental} and seasonally changing social organisation including maternity roosts, hibernation roosts and swarming sites \cite{kerth2008causes}.
Finally, their ability to fly means populations can be well mixed across large distances \cite{peel2013continent, petit1999male} but this is highly variable with some species having limited dispersal \cite{wilmer1994extreme}.






\section{Influence of Population density and structure on pathogen richness}


\tmpsection{Theoretical evidence that structure and density increase richness}

% Density

The role of population density and abundance in disease dynamics is well established \cite{may1979population, anderson1979population, heesterbeek2002brief, lloyd2005should}.
Broadly, larger populations can maintain diseases more easily, due to having a larger pool of susceptible individuals (individuals without acquired immunity) and having a greater number of new susceptible individuals enter the population by birth or immigration \cite{may1979population, anderson1979population}.
High density populations are expected to have a greater number of contacts between individuals and so promote disease spread (though there is much discussion on when the number of contacts might scale independently of density \cite{mccallum2001should}).

% Structure

There is a large literature on the role of population structure on disease dynamics (see review by \textcite{pastor2015epidemic}) driven by applications to computer viruses \cite{pastor2001epidemic} and the social spread of information \cite{goffman1964generalization}, as well as health applications.
In particular work has concentrated on how structure affects the invasion threshold, $R_0$ \cite{colizza2007invasion, barthelemy2010fluctuation, wu2013threshold, may2001infection, pastor2001epidemic}. 
This value combines relevant parameters to yield a threshold above which a disease is expected to infect a significant proportion of the population \cite{may1979population, anderson1979population}.
Below the threshold, only small outbreaks that quickly die out are expected.

However, the majority of theoretical work considers single pathogens.
Single pathogen models suggest whether a pathogen can spread and persist in a population, ignoring all other pathogens.
A number of studies examine competing epidemics---when two pathogens spread at the same time, which pathogen infects more individuals?---and have found increasing population structure reduces dominance of one strain \cite{van2014domination, poletto2013host, poletto2015characterising}.
However, this again tells us little about how pathogen communities form and what factors control total pathogen richness.
Many fewer papers explicitely study the longer term competition between two or more pathogens.
Those that do commonly find that competitive exclusion is likely \cite{castillo1995dynamics, bremermann1989competitive, martcheva2013competitive, ackleh2003competitive, ackleh2014robust, turner2002impact}.
Mechanisms that have been shown to allow pathogen coexistence include superinfection \cite{may1994superinfection, li2010age}, density-dependant deaths \cite{ackleh2003competitive, kirupaharan2004coexistence} and differing transmission routes \cite{allen2003dynamics}.

The specific role of density on the ability of pathogens to coexist has not been theoretically studied though it is commonly found to promote pathogen richness in comparative empirical studies \cite{kamiya2014determines, nunn2003comparative, arneberg2002host}.
The few papers that have directly studied how coexistence of pathogens responds to population structure have found population structure can allow pathogens to coexist when competitive exclusion would occur in a fully mixed population \cite{qiu2013vector, allen2004sis, nunes2006localized}.
Furthermore, genetic diversity has shown to be maximised at intermediate levels of population structure \cite{campos2006pathogen}.
The roles of population structure and social group size have been examined in comparative studies \cite{maganga2014bat, gay2014parasite, turmelle2009correlates, altizer2003social, bordes2007rodent, ezenwa2006host, rifkin2012animals, vitone2004body}.
There is much disagreement between these studies with population structure being shown to promote \cite{maganga2014bat, turmelle2009correlates} and inhibit pathogen richness \cite{gay2014parasite} and similarly group size being shown to promote \cite{rifkin2012animals, bordes2007rodent} and inhibit \cite{ezenwa2006host} richness.
While increased group size should generally decrease population structure the literature is rarely clear on how these variables relate.




\section{Thesis overview}

In this thesis I examine the role of population structure and density on pathogen richness.
I use bats as a case study throughout due to their interesting social structure and importance as zoonotic	reservoires.
I combine empirical, comparative studies with simulation models.
This allows me to study specific mechanisms while linking my theoretical insights to real world tests.


\tmpsection{Chapter 2}

First, in Chapter \ref{ch:empirical}, I empirically test the hypothesis that population structure is associated with pathogen richness in wild bat populations.
I used two measurements of population structure---the number of subspecies and gene flow---and a larger dataset than previous studies.
For both measurements I found that bat species with more structured populations have more known viruses.
This relationship is robust to controlling for study bias and phylogenetic nonindependance.
I also tested for a relationship between body mass and range size, finding strong support for larger bodied bats carrying more viruses and mixed support for range size promoting pathogen richness.

\tmpsection{Chapter 3}

In Chapter \ref{ch:sims1} I examine one specific mechanism by which population structure may promote increased pathogen richness.
I tested whether increased population structure can allow newly evolved pathogen strains to invade and persist more easily.
I modelled bat populations as individual-based, stochastic meta-populations and examine the competition dynamics of two identical pathogen strains.
I tested two factors related to population structure: dispersal rate and the number of links between subpopulations.
I found that, at a number of different transmission rates, neither of these factors altered the probability of newly evolved pathogens invading and persisting in the population.

\tmpsection{Chapter 4}

Next I examine the relationships between a number of elements of population structure (Chapter \ref{ch:sims2}).
I clarified the interdependances between range size, and population size and density.
I also noted that population size can be decomposed into colony size and colony density (the number of colonies per unit area).
Using the same model as Chapter \ref{ch:sims1}, I then tested which of these factors are most important in promoting pathogen richness.
Specifically I tested which factor most strongly promotes the invasion and establishment of newly evolved pathogens.
I found that population size is more important than population density and that colony size is the important component of population size.

\tmpsection{Chapter 5}

Given the importance of population size on pathogen richness it is important to have good estimates of these for wild bat populations.
However, there are currently very few measurements of bat abundance due to their small size, nocturnal habit and difficulties in identification.
Therefore I aimed to develop a method for estimating bat abundance from acoustic data, specifically data collected by the iBats project \cite{jones2011indicator}.
In Chapter \ref{ch:grem} I present a generally applicable method---based on random encounter models \cite{rowcliffe2008estimating, yapp1956theory}---for estimating abundance of animal populations using camera traps or acoustic deteectors.
I used spatial simulations to test the method for biases and to assess it's precision.
I found that the method is unbiased and precise as long as a reasonable amount of data is collected.
