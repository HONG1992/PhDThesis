\section{Abstract}


\subsubsection{One or two sentences providing a basic introduction to the field}
% comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline.
An increasingly large fraction of emerging diseases come from animals \cite{jones2008global, taylor2001risk} and these diseases have a huge impact on human health.
The chance that a new disease will come from any particularly wild host species increases with the diversity of pathogens in that species.
However, the factors that control pathogen diversity in wild populations are still unknown.



\subsubsection{Two to three sentences of more detailed background}
% comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines.

% Add mechanistic vs empirical
Host species traits such as population density, longevity, body size and population structure have been shown to correlate with pathogen diversity.
However, our mechanistic understanding of how population structure (i.e. non random contacts across the population creating barriers to disease spread) affects pathogen diversity is poor.
Greater mechanistic understanding is needed to clarify the exact causal role population structure has in controlling pathogen diversity.
Mechanistic models are also likely to be more robust to transferring understanding between taxa and predicting changes. % !!! Not great.

Typically it is assumed that well-connected populations promote disease spread (high $R_0$) and therefore promote pathogen diversity.
However, if competition is strong endemic pathogens will dominate and prevent new diseases from invading and spreading. \cite{ackleh2003competitive,bremermann1989competitive,martcheva2013competitive,qiu2013vector}
In a structured population, stochastic effects could create areas of low prevalence of the endemic disease, allowing new diseases to invade.

We consider bats as a case study as they have been implicated in a number of recent, high profile diseases such as Ebola, SARS, Hendra and Nipah.
Bats have varied social structures and so the structure of populations could be one way to prioritise zoonotic disease surveillance in this group.

\subsubsection{One sentence clearly stating the general problem (the gap)}
% being addressed by this particular study.
It is unknown whether population structure allows escape from competition and therefore high diversity.

We hypothesise that low dispersal rates and a low number of connections in a metapopulation network will allow invading pathogens to establish more readily. 

\subsubsection{One sentence summarising the main result}
%  (with the words “here we show” or their equivalent).
I find that neither population connectedness nor dispersal rate affect the probability that a new pathogen will invade into a population.

\subsubsection{Two or three sentences explaining what the main result reveals in direct comparison to what was thought to be the case previously}
% or how the main result adds to previous knowledge
The common assumption that factors causing high $R_0$ allow new pathogens to invade and therefore increase pathogen diversity is not supported by our study.
Instead we find that changes in population structure that would affect $R_0$ do not affect the probability of invasion of a new pathogen.


\subsubsection{One or two sentences to put the results into a more general context.}
This result means that large scale population structure does not seem to control pathogen diversity.
This also implies that population structure is not a useful proxy for pathogen diversity with respect to zoonotic disease surveillance, for example in bats.

\subsection{General Intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% A basic introduction to the field,
% comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline.


\subsubsection{Why is pathogen diversity important?}

The diversity of pathogens in a wild animal species strongly affects the chance that a disease from that species will infect humans.
As over 50\% of emerging infectious diseases have an animal source  \cite{jones2008global}, understanding and predicting this process is a global health priority.
However, the factors that control the diversity of pathogens in a wild animal population are still unclear.


\subsubsection{We know some factors that correlate with pathogen diversity}
A number of host traits have been shown to correlate with pathogen richness including body size  \cite{kamiya2014determines, arneberg2002host}, population density \cite{nunn2003comparative, arneberg2002host} and range size \cite{bordes2011impact, kamiya2014determines}.




\subsubsection{But we do not understand the mechanistic processes}

However, empirical, correlative studies are often contradictory due to small sample sizes, noisy data and because empirical relationships often do not generalise across taxa (though see \cite{kamiya2014determines} for a meta-analysis).
Furthermore, the correlation between many traits (e.g. \cite{nunn2015infectious}) makes it hard to clearly distinguish which factors are important.
Knowing the factors that correlate with pathogen richness also does not tell us how it controls richness. 
Mechanisms by which a trait could increase pathogen diversity include promoting the evolution of new strains within a species \cite{buckee2004effects}, reduction of the rate of parasite extinction and an increased probability of pathogen invasion from other species.
These seperate mechanisms have not been examined and it is difficult to see how they could be approached through comparitive methods.
We need explicit mechanistic models in order to tease apart these factors.








\subsection{Specific Intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% more detailed background}
% comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines.


\subsubsection{Population structure could be important}
One host-species trait that has been largely understudied with respect to pathogen diversity is population structure.
Population structure has been comprehensively studied with respect to single or competing epidemics in human populations, wildlife populations and technological networks.
However, the assumption that population structures that yield high $R_0$ will also give high pathogen diversity \cite{nunn2003comparative} is unfounded.




\subsubsection{We cannot assume high $R_0$ gives high diversity}
The processes by which a single disease spreads through a population are very well studied.
One commonly taken assumption is that factors that promote high disease spread automatically promotes high diversity.
However, this ignores competitive mechanisms such as cross-immunity and depletion of susceptible hosts.
A number of authors have demonstrated a competitive exclusion principle where only the most optimally spreading disease will survive when infection with one pathogen prevents infection with another pathogen \cite{bremermann1989competitive, martcheva2013competitive, ackleh2003competitive, ackleh2014robust, turner2002impact}.
If competitive mechanisms are strong, pathogens in populations structured such that $R_0$ will be high will be able to easily out-compete invading pathogens.
Only if competitive mechanisms are weak will high $R_0$  enable the invasion of new pathogens and allow higher pathogen diversity.

Competitive affects are likely to be more or less important depending on the mechanism by which pathogen diversity is created.
Competition is likely to be very strong between a newly evolved strain and the existing strain of a pathogen. 
In this case, there is likely to be strong cross immunity between strains.
In the case of pathogens invading from other hosts species, cross immunity is likely to be less strong due to the evolutionary distance between the new and endemic pathogens.
However, competition could still occur as disease induced mortality of host individuals reduces host density which promotes pathogen persistance.
Finally, it is unclear how competition would affect the persistance of pathogens once they are established, though is seems that cross immunity can keep a pathogen at a low prevalence in the population (e.g. monkey pox \cite{rimoin2010major} and monkey malaria \cite{cox2008knowlesi}). 
This would make stochastic extinction more likely.

The important affects of population structure on single disease epidemic spread and competing epidemics shows the important role structure has on disease dynamics.
We can therefore expect it to have an important role in the dynamics of multidisease systems as well.

\subsubsection{Network structure has been studied}
 
% Analytical models
% +netCoex

Studies of the role of population structure on pathogen diversity have been in very simple systems.
These have been so simple that empirical data cannot easily be applied to them to predict pathogen diversity of real wild animal populations.
There is a need for models that can be carefully and fully explored, while still capturing the complexities of the real world.

Analytical models of well mixed have widely different outcomes: infinite diversity \cite{may1994superinfection, ackleh2014robust} or competitive exclusion have both been predicted \cite{ackleh2003competitive,bremermann1989competitive,martcheva2013competitive,qiu2013vector,allen2004sis}
When competitive exclusion occurs, population structure has sometimes been shown to allow coexistence \cite{qiu2013vector,allen2004sis, nunes2006localized}.

Competing epidemics, or two pathogens spreading at the same time in a population, is a well studied area \cite{poletto2013host, poletto2015characterising, karrer2011competing}. 
This area is related to the study of pathogen richness in that they indicate that dynamics of multiple pathogens in a population do depend on population structure.
However, the results for short term epidemic competition do not directly transfer to the study of long term disease persistence.




\subsubsection{Empirical evidence that structure might affect diversity}

% Mammals



% Bats
Few studies focus on bats, despite their role in recent zoonoses.
Maganga \emph{et al.} found that distribution fragmentation predicts viral richness \cite{maganga2014bat}, but \cite{gay2014parasite} finds the opposite relationship. 
While the data set in \cite{gay2014parasite} is larger, the analysis in \cite{maganga2014bat} is much more focused on fragmentation.

Genetic correlates of population structure have also been used.
Turmelle \emph{et al.} \cite{turmelle2009correlates}, in a small analysis, find that high $F_{st}$ (i.e. a structured population) correlates with high richness.



\subsubsection{Types of population structure}

How structured a population is can be defined in many ways on many scales.
The most relevant scale is that of an epidemiological population.
This is the population within which a pathogen can spread in an epidemiologically relevant time period (years or decades).
It is therefore closely related to a population as defined by population genetics, but with movement defined on a shorter time scale.

The epidemiological contacts within the population can be examined at the individual level (as in contact network epidemiology) or larger scales.
We consider the metapopulation network the most appropriate.
Ignoring the metapopulation assumes a fully mixed population which is unlikely.
Trying to study the contact network relies detailed individual level detail which is not available.
Metapopulation models consider a network of small subpopulations. 
Within subpopulations, epidemiological contacts are fully mixed and relatively fast.
Between subpopulations, epidemiological contacts are dependant on an underlying network structure and relatively slow.
The network underlying the metapopulation is made up of nodes representing the subpopulations, and edges which represent movement between subpopulations.
Animals, and therefore infection, can only move between two subpopulations if they are connected by an edge.

There are two factors that affect how structured a population is, given this model framework.
Firstly, dispersal is the rate at which individuals move between subpopulations.
Secondly, the metapopulation network structure controls population structure.
The simplest measure of how structured the network is the average number of edges each node has.
In the extremes, all subpopulations could be either connected to all other subpopulations or only connected to one or two other subpopulations.
However, other measures that take into account second-order structure in the network are also often used.




\subsubsection{Why bats}
Bats (Order Chiroptera) have, over the last decade, become a focus for disease research  \cite{calisher2006bats, hughes2007emerging}.
Recently they have been implicated in a number of high profile diseases such as Ebola, SARS, Hendra and Nipah  \cite{calisher2006bats, li2005bats}.

A number of traits have been suggested as predisposing bats towards being reservoirs of zoonotic diseases: high sympatry \cite{luis2013comparison}, flight \cite{wang2011mass} and longevity \cite{wang2011mass}

Bats have an unusual variety of social structures.
Group living ranges from colonies 10--1 million \cite{jones2009pantheria}.
Many bats also have interesting seasonal behaviour such as migration \cite{richter2008first, fleming2003ecology}


\subsection{The gap}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% One sentence clearly stating the general problem
% being addressed by this particular study.
% By this stage, must have defined/introduced all terms used within.

We have very abstract, simplified models that predict zero or infinite diversity depending on specifics.
These cannot be easily applied to real data.
They also do not easily predict quantitative or even relative diversity as they often predict either zero or infinite diversity with nothing in between.

We need models that can quantitatively or at least relatively predict diversity in a populations.
This requires a middle ground of model diversity.

There are no studies that directly model bat pathogen diversity.

Specifically we use these models to test the affects of population structure on the ability of a new pathogen to invade a population.
We test two aspects of structure, dispersal rate and connectedness of the metapopulation network.


\subsection{What I did}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


I have run epidemiological simulations based broadly on real world bat populations.
Although still simplified, the model is complex enough that if good measurements of bat populations could be found, simulations of the real world bat population could be run.

I have studied the invasion of new pathogens as a mechanisms for increasing pathogen richness.
In particular I have focussed on studying the invasion of a newly evolved pathogen that is therefore identical in epidemiological parameters to the endemic pathogen.
Furthermore, this close evolutionary relationship means that cross immunity is strong.
Note: I think I probably should run sims for two species together to also study the mechanism of pathogen extinction.

I have studied two metrics for population structure, dispersal rate and metapopulation network topology, to test for effects of population structure on pathogen richness.

\subsection{What I found}

\subsection{Metapopulation model}




\subsubsection{Two pathogen SIR model}

We examine a multpathogen SIR model. 
This is a compartment model with individuals being classed as susceptible, infected or recovered with immunity (Figure~\ref{f:sir}).
Susceptible individuals are counted in class $S$.
There are three infected classes, $I_1$, $I_2$ and $I_{12}$, being individuals infected with pathogen 1, pathogen 2 or both respectively.
Recovered individuals, $R$, are immune to both pathogens, even if they have only been infected with one.
Furthermore, recovery from a pathogen moves an individual straight into the recovered class, even if the individual is infected with both pathogen.
This modelling choice allows the model to be easily expanded to included more than two pathogens.
The assumption of immediate recovery from all other diseases is likely to be quite accurate for very closely related pathogens as is being studied here as once an acquired immune response is activated, all infections are likely to be cleared quickly.

The coinfection rate is adjusted compared to the first infection rate by a factor $\alpha$.
Birth and death rates are assumed to be equal, $b = d$.


\subsubsection{Metapopulation}


The population is divided into a number of subpopulations.
This metapopulation is modelled as a network with subpopulations being nodes and dispersal between subpopulations being indicated by edges (Figure~\ref{f:net})
Individuals with a subpopulation interact randomly so that the subpopulation is fully mixed.
However, dispersal between subpopulations occurs at a rate $\lambda$.
Individuals can only disperse to subpopulations connected to theirs in the network.
The rate of dispersal is not affected by the number of edges a subpopulation has (the degree of the subpopulation).
So the dispersal rate from a subpopulation $m$ with degree $k_m$ to subpopulation $n$ is $\frac{\lambda}{k_m}$.
Note this rate is independent of the degree of subpopulation $n$.





\subsubsection{Stochastic simulations}

We examine this model using stochastic, continuous time simulations using the Gillespie algorithm.
At each step in the simulation we calculate the rate that each possible event might occur.
One event is then randomly chosen, weighted by it's rate
\begin{align}
  p(\text{event } i) = \frac{r_i}{\sum_i r_i}
\end{align}
where $r_i$ is the rate that event $i$ occurs.
Finally, the length of the time step, $\delta$, is drawn from an exponential distribution 
\begin{align}
  \delta \sim \operatorname{Exp}\left(\sum_i r_i  \right).
\end{align}
This means that the length of each simulation is stochastic. 
We define the number of events we wish to simulate instead.

  \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{imgs/SIRoption1.pdf}
  \caption{The SIR model used.}
  \label{f:sir}
\end{figure}


We can now write down the rates of all events. 
I define $I^+_p$ to be the sum of all classes that are infectious with pathogen $p$, for example $I^+_1 = I_1 + I_{12}$. 
Assuming asexual reproduction, that all classes reproduce at the same rate and that individuals are born into the susceptible class we get
\begin{align}
  P\left( S_{nt^\prime} = S_{nt} +1\right) &= b\left( S_{nt}+\sum_q I_{qnt} + R_{nt}\right) 
\end{align}
where $P\left( S_{nt^\prime} = S_{nt} +1\right)$ is the probability that the number of susceptibles in subpopulation $n$ will increase by 1 (a single birth) the short time interval $t$ to $t^\prime$ and $\sum_q I_{qnt}$ is the sum of all infection classes $q \in {1, 2, 12}$.
The rates of death, given a death rate $d$ are given by
\begin{align}
  P\left( S_{nt^\prime} = S_{nt}-1 \right) &= dS_{nt} \\
  P\left( I_{qnt^\prime} = I_{qnt}-1 \right) &= dI_{qnt}\\
  P\left( R_{nt^\prime} = R_{nt}-1 \right) &= dR_{nt}.
\end{align}
Infection of a susceptible with either pathogen 1 or 2, $S \rightarrow I_p$ where $p\in \{1,2\}$, is given by
\begin{align}
  P\left( I_{pnt^\prime} = I_{pnt}+1, S_{nt^\prime} = S_{nt}-1 \right) &= \beta S_{nt}I^+_{pnt},
\end{align}
while coinfection, given a crossimmunity factor $\alpha$, is given by
\begin{align}
  P\left( I_{12,nt^\prime} = I_{12,nt}+1,\: I_{pnt^\prime} = I_{pnt}-1\right) = \alpha\beta I_{nt}I^+_{pnt}.
\end{align}
The probability of migration from colony $m$ (with degree $k_m$) to colony $n$, given a dispersal rate $\lambda$ is given by
\begin{align}
  P\left(S_{nt^\prime}=S_{nt}+1,\: S_{mt^\prime} = S_{mt}-1\right) &= \frac{\lambda S_{mt}}{k_m-1}\\
  P\left(I_{qnt^\prime}=I_{qnt}+1,\: I_{qmt^\prime} = I_{qmt}-1\right) &= \frac{\lambda I_{qmt}}{k_m}\\
  P\left(R_{nt^\prime}=S_{nt}+1,\: R_{mt^\prime} = R_{mt}-1\right) &= \frac{\lambda R_{mt}}{k_m}.
\end{align}
Finally, recovery from any infectious class occurs at a rate $\gamma$
\begin{align}
  P\left( I_{qnt^\prime} = I_{qnt}-1,\: R_{nt^\prime} = R_{nt}+1 \right) &= \gamma I_{qnt}.
\end{align}
