PhD Thesis
===========

This is a repo containing my PhD Thesis.

The template is taken from [here](https://github.com/ucl/ucl-latex-thesis-templates).

The main file is [tim-lucas-thesis.tex](tim-lucas-thesis.tex) and [tim-lucas-thesis.[df](tim-lucas-thesis.pdf) is the compiled pdf which should render in github (maybe slowly).

The following files contain the main content of the thesis.
- [Introduction.tex](Introduction.tex)
- [Chapter2.tex](Chapter2.tex)
- [Chapter3.tex](Chapter3.tex)
- [Chapter4.tex](Chapter4.tex)
- [Chapter5.tex](Chapter5.tex)
- [Conclusions.tex](Conclusions.tex)

With Chapter2-5.tex being the four data chapters.
