PhD Thesis
===========

This is a repo containing my PhD Thesis.

The template is taken from [here](https://github.com/ucl/ucl-latex-thesis-templates).

The main file is [tim-lucas-thesis.tex](tim-lucas-thesis.tex) and [tim-lucas-thesis.pdf](tim-lucas-thesis.pdf) is the compiled pdf which should render in github (maybe slowly).

The following files contain the main content of the thesis.
- [Introduction.tex](Introduction.tex)
- [Chapter2.tex](Chapter2.tex)
- [Chapter3.tex](Chapter3.tex)
- [Chapter4.tex](Chapter4.tex)
- [Chapter5.tex](Chapter5.tex)
- [Conclusions.tex](Conclusions.tex)

With Chapter2-5.tex being the four data chapters.
The data chapters are written as .Rtex files with embedded R code. These files are `Chapter*.Rtex`.

While [tim-lucas-thesis.pdf](tim-lucas-thesis.pdf) is the full thesis pdf, most chapters are also compiled seperately. These files are 

- [Chapter_2_draft.pdf](Chapter_2_draft.pdf)
- [Chapter_3_draft.pdf](Chapter_3_draft.pdf)
- [Chapter_5_draft.pdf](Chapter_5_draft.pdf)

Pretty Thesis
-------------

As the required formatting for a UCL thesis is rather uninspiring I am also creating a file that is formatted in a way that I think is attractive and readable. 

The files for this version are in [PrettyThesis](PrettyThesis) and the combined pdf is [PrettyThesis/tim-lucas-pretty-thesis.pdf](PrettyThesis/tim-lucas-pretty-thesis.pdf).
